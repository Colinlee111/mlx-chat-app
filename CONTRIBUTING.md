# Welcome to our contribution guide

Thank you for wanting to contribute to our project! We apprecaite any contributions that you make.

Chat with MLX is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the application itself.

## New Contributor Guide

- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

### Issues

**Create**: If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue!

**Solve**: Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/mlx-chat/mlx-chat-app) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to assign it to yourself and open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes
3. Commit and send a pull request 

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.
- Check to see your pull request passes our continuous integration (CI). If you cannot get a certain integration test to pass, let us know. We can assist you in fixing these issues or approve a merge manually.
- Make sure your additions are properly documented!
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
